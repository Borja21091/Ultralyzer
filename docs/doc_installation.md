# Installation

## System Requirements

Ultralyzer is compatible with Linux, Windows, and MacOS systems that support Python 3.12 (tested) or higher. The software leverages hardware acceleration for image processing and GUI rendering, so a system with a dedicated GPU is recommended for optimal performance, although not strictly necessary.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Borja21091/Ultralyzer.git
   cd Ultralyzer
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   conda create -n ultralyzer_env python=3.12
   conda activate ultralyzer_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
